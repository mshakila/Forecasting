# Forecasting

Business Problem :  We have to forecast :
1. passengers (count) of Airlines data - used R package to forecast
2. quarterly sales of Coca cola -used R package to forecast
3. monthly sales of Plastic - used Python  package to forecast

I have first pre-processed the data: created dummy variables, new variables, split the data.
I have used model based and data-driven approaches for forecasting.
I have used acf and pacf plots to find significant lags  for original and residual data
I have used RMSE and MAPE to compare the results (details in excel sheet attached) of all 3 problems.
